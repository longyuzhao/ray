/// This scheduling policy was designed with the following assumptions in mind:
///   1. Scheduling a task on a new node incurs a cold start penalty (warming the worker
///   pool).
///   2. Past a certain utilization threshold, a big noisy neighbor problem occurs (caused
///   by object spilling).
///   3. Locality is helpful, but generally outweighed by (1) and (2).
///
/// In order to solve these problems, we use the following scheduling policy.
///   1. Generate a traversal.
///   2. Run a priority scheduler.
///
/// A node's priorities are determined by the following factors:
///   * Always skip infeasible nodes
///   * Always prefer available nodes over feasible nodes.
///   * Break ties in available/feasible by critical resource utilization.
///   * Critical resource utilization below a threshold should be truncated to 0.
///
/// The traversal order should:
///   * Prioritize the local node above all others.
///   * All other nodes should have a globally fixed priority across the cluster.
///
/// We call this a hybrid policy because below the threshold, the traversal and truncation
/// properties will lead to packing of nodes. Above the threshold, the policy will act
/// like a traditional weighted round robin.
///
/// \param resource_request: The resource request we're attempting to schedule.
/// \param local_node_id: The id of the local node, which is needed for traversal order.
/// \param nodes: The summary view of all the nodes that can be scheduled on.
/// \param spread_threshold: Below this threshold, critical resource utilization will be
/// truncated to 0.
/// \param scheduler_avoid_gpu_nodes: if set, we would try scheduling
/// CPU-only requests on CPU-only nodes, and will fallback to scheduling on GPU nodes if
/// needed.

/// schedule on.
